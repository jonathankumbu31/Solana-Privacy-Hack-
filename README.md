# Solana-Privacy-Hack-
A pre-transaction privacy and security layer for Solana that protects users before signing. It performs local first risk checks to flag malicious or high-risk addresses without leaking intent to explorers or APIs. Demonstrated as a browser extension and designed as integratable privacy tooling for wallets and apps.
